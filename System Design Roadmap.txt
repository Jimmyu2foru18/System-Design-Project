# Recipe Index Website - Full Roadmap

## **1. Project Overview**
A dynamic recipe index website that allows users to browse, save, rate, and post recipes. 
The system will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, SQL for the database, 
and a RESTful API for the back end, integrated with AWS for hosting and scalability. 
The website will focus on an engaging user experience, easy navigation, and fast 
performance while maintaining strong security standards.

## **2. Technology Stack**
### **Front-End**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: The core technologies for building a responsive and interactive UI.
- **CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS**: Ensures a modern and scalable design with pre-built components.
- **AJAX / Fetch API**: Enables asynchronous API calls for dynamic content updates without page refreshes.
- **React.js (Optional)**: If scalability is needed in the future, React can be used for state management 
							and UI updates.

### **Back-End**
- **Node.js + Express.js**: Handles HTTP requests, API logic, authentication, and routing.
- **Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Secure token-based authentication for user sessions.
- **Security Enhancements**: Using Helmet.js for HTTP headers security, CORS for cross-origin security, and rate limiting for API protection.

### **Database**
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: A relational database structure to store users, recipes, ratings, and favorites efficiently.
- **Structured Schema Design**:
  - **Users**: Stores user information and authentication data.
  - **Recipes**: Contains recipe details, images, and user-generated content.
  - **Ratings & Favorites**: Keeps track of user interactions, ratings, and saved recipes.

### **API Design**
- **RESTful API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)**: Follows RESTful principles for modular and scalable backend communication.
- **AWS API Gateway Integration**: Manages traffic, enforces security policies, and improves API performance.

### **Hosting & Deployment (AWS)**
- **Front-End Hosting**: AWS S3 + CloudFront for static file hosting with global CDN distribution.
- **Back-End Deployment**: AWS EC2 for backend application hosting.
- **Database Management**: AWS RDS for fully managed SQL database services with automated backups.
- **Load Balancing & Monitoring**: AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) for traffic distribution and AWS CloudWatch for performance monitoring.

## **3. System Architecture**

### **Front-End Structure**
- **Landing Page**: Provides an introduction to the website, sign-up/login buttons, and featured recipes in a scrollable format.
- **Recipe Index Page**: Displays a searchable and filterable list of all recipes from the database.
- **Recipe Detail Page**: Shows complete details of a selected recipe, including ingredients, instructions, nutritional information, and user ratings.
- **User Profile Page**: Allows users to manage their account, view saved recipes, and submit new recipes.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manages user-generated content, monitors site analytics, and moderates submissions.

### **Back-End Structure**
- **Authentication Module**: Handles user registration, login, password recovery, and social media authentication.
- **Recipe Management Module**: Enables CRUD operations on recipes, images, and associated metadata.
- **User Profile Module**: Manages user details, saved recipes, created recipes, and interaction history.
- **Search & Filtering Module**: Allows users to filter recipes based on ingredients, cuisine, dietary preferences, and ratings.
- **Admin Module**: Provides analytics dashboards, content moderation, and user management capabilities.

## **4. Development Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Planning & Design**
- Define the complete project scope and functional requirements.
- Create wireframe designs for all pages to visualize UI/UX.
- Set up GitHub repository and establish version control workflow.
- Finalize AWS architecture and deployment strategy.
- Choose frameworks and technologies for both front-end and back-end.

### **Phase 2: Front-End Development**
- Develop the landing page with dynamic scrolling recipe cards.
- Implement user authentication UI with sign-up, login, and profile pages.
- Create the recipe index page with search and filter options.
- Fetch mock data via a temporary API to test UI interactions.
- Ensure full mobile responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Set up reusable UI components for consistent styling and functionality.

### **Phase 3: Back-End Development**
- Set up the Node.js + Express.js environment.
- Design and implement the SQL database schema.
- Develop API endpoints for user authentication, recipe management, and search.
- Implement JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
- Test API functionality using Postman and integrate with front-end.
- Configure API error handling, validation, and logging mechanisms.

### **Phase 4: API & Database Integration**
- Deploy the database to AWS RDS and configure automated backups.
- Deploy the REST API to AWS EC2 or AWS Lambda.
- Optimize API response times using caching techniques (Redis).
- Perform stress testing and optimize SQL queries for performance.
- Implement pagination and rate limiting for API scalability.

### **Phase 5: Additional Features & Testing**
- Enable user-generated recipe submissions with image uploads.
- Implement rating and favorite features for user engagement.
- Enhance search with fuzzy matching and autocomplete suggestions.
- Optimize front-end performance by lazy loading images and assets.
- Conduct unit testing and end-to-end testing.

### **Phase 6: Deployment & Monitoring**
- Deploy the front-end to AWS S3 and integrate with CloudFront.
- Deploy the back-end and database to AWS infrastructure.
- Set up logging, error tracking, and monitoring with AWS CloudWatch.
- Conduct usability testing and fix any UI/UX issues.
- Set up automated CI/CD pipelines for future updates.

## **5. Security Considerations**
- Implement HTTPS with SSL certificates (AWS Certificate Manager).
- Use JWT Authentication to prevent unauthorized API access.
- Secure database queries to protect against SQL Injection attacks.
- Enable AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to prevent DDoS attacks.

---

## **6. Performance Optimization**
- Use AWS CloudFront for content delivery and reduced latency.
- Optimize images with compression techniques to reduce load time.
- Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed recipe data.
- Distribute traffic with AWS Load Balancers for high availability.
- Unit and performance testing to identify bottlenecks.
