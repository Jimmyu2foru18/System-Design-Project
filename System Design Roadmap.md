# Recipe Index Website - Full Roadmap

## **1. Project Overview**
A dynamic recipe index website that allows users to browse, save, rate, and post recipes. 
The system will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end, SQL for the database, 
and a RESTful API for the back end, integrated with AWS for hosting and scalability. 
The website will focus on an engaging user experience, easy navigation, and fast 
performance while maintaining strong security standards.

- **Elasticsearch**: For advanced recipe search functionality and autocomplete features

### **Database**
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**: A relational database structure to store users, recipes, ratings, and favorites efficiently.
- **Structured Schema Design**:
  - **Users**: Stores user information and authentication data.
  - **Recipes**: Contains recipe details, images, and user-generated content.
  - **Ratings & Favorites**: Keeps track of user interactions, ratings, and saved recipes.
- **Database Scaling Strategy**:
  - **Read Replicas**: For handling high-volume read operations
  - **Sharding Strategy**: For horizontal scaling of data
  - **Backup & Recovery Plan**: Regular snapshots and point-in-time recovery
- **Data Migration Strategy**: Plans for schema updates and data evolution

### **API Design**
- **RESTful API (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)**: Follows RESTful principles for modular and scalable backend communication.
- **AWS API Gateway Integration**: Manages traffic, enforces security policies, and improves API performance.
- **API Versioning Strategy**: Supporting multiple API versions for backward compatibility
- **API Documentation**: Using Swagger/OpenAPI for clear API documentation
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling**: Implementing tiered API access limits
- **API Monitoring**: Tracking API usage, performance metrics, and error rates

### **Hosting & Deployment (AWS)**
- **Front-End Hosting**: AWS S3 + CloudFront for static file hosting with global CDN distribution.
- **Back-End Deployment**: AWS EC2 for backend application hosting.
- **Database Management**: AWS RDS for fully managed SQL database services with automated backups.
- **Load Balancing & Monitoring**: AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) for traffic distribution and AWS CloudWatch for performance monitoring.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Multi-region failover strategy
- **Auto-scaling Configuration**: Rules for scaling based on traffic patterns
- **Content Delivery Strategy**: Image and static content optimization
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless background tasks and image processing
